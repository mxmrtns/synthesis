                Information, particularly in analog form, is often location-bound. Be it in the researcher’s head, on sheets of paper, sticky notes, or even in digital form — research findings in the first instance are silos of information. 

                The research data, although potentially of great use, can be overwhelming and unclear [1].
                    
                <br> <br>
                In this form, it is difficult to manipulate the data and to forge connections, in order to develop a shared understanding and to eventually make sense out of the data.
                    
                Hence, an important aspect of design synthesis is to move away from theses silos of information and to bring the collected data into one cohesive visual structure.
                
                <br> <br>
                Externalization refers to the effort of getting thoughts, reflections and ideas out of our individual minds and making them tangible. 
                    
                By forcing an external view on data, thoughts and ideas become something that can be discussed, defined, embraced or rejected by any number of people and the ideas become part of a larger process of synthesis (Kolko, 2015, p. 16).*
                
                In practice, externalisation is frequently done by writing post-its and putting them up on a shared wall.
                
                This process represents a vital step during and after data collection, as it helps to quickly reduce complexity and communicate more effectively. 
                
                Further, there is a natural limit to the cognitive capacity of a human. The quantity of data to be analyzed is often too large to hold in the attentive memory at one time 
                
                Externalization can be used to avoid a potential loss of information and to reduce complexitiy and cognitive load
                
                By taking the data out of the cognitive realm and removing it from the digital real, and making it tangible  in the physical realm in one cohessive visual structure you are free from the natural memory limitations of the brain and the artificial organizational limitations of technology
