            As recent developments have shown, the issue about the consequences of genetic engineering is more relevant than ever and it will be important to have a public debate about it.

            In November 2018, the Chinese scientist He Jiankui caused an international outcry with an experiment he claimed to have successfully conducted. He Jiankui had used a technology called CRISPR to create the first gene-edited babies. The experiment, which has been widely condemned as irresponsible, represents a significant and controversial leap in the use of genome editing. 
            
            He’s actions on the other hand raise a lot of questions and leave room for speculation. Where some see a new form of medicine that eliminates genetic disease, others see a starting point for enhancements, designer babies, and a new form of eugenics. 
            
            It would be naive to think that we might simply hit the brakes and stop the progress. No matter how convincing the ethical arguments may be, it is hard to see how they can hold back the next step for long, especially if what is at stake — the possibility of prolonging human life indefinitely, conquering incurable diseases and upgrading our cognitive and emotional abilities.
            
            The only thing we can do is to influence the direction we are taking and to debate how a desirable future with genetic engineering might look like.
